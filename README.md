Taqseem is revolutionizing food distribution by creating a real-time network between donors, NGOs, and volunteers. Whether it's a restaurant with leftover meals, a grocery store with surplus produce, or an individual with extra food, our platform ensures it reaches people who need it most - efficiently and without waste.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è &nbsp;Problem Statement 

<blockquote style="font-size: 18px;">
"Every year, 1.3 billion tons of food is wasted globally while 821 million people go hungry."
<br> <br>
"Current food donation systems are fragmented, slow, and lack real-time coordination between donors and charities."
</blockquote>
<br>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/196402/icode/">FAO</a>, food waste represents a $1 trillion economic loss annually while exacerbating hunger and environmental problems.</p> 

The challenge is twofold: perfectly good food goes to waste because donors don't have efficient ways to connect with distribution networks, while NGOs struggle to locate and coordinate timely pickups of available food. Traditional systems rely on manual coordination, leading to delays, spoilage, and missed opportunities to feed those in need.

<strong>Sustainability</strong>: Taqseem reduces food waste by redirecting perfectly edible surplus food from restaurants, events, and individuals that would otherwise end up in landfills, producing harmful methane emissions. Through smart logistics powered by real-time location data and Gemini AI, it matches food with nearby NGOs to minimize spoilage and cut down the energy use associated with long-distance transport. The platform fosters an eco-friendly culture by raising awareness of sustainable food practices and encouraging active participation from both individuals and businesses. By digitizing the entire process‚Äîthrough automated alerts, smart matching, and dashboards‚ÄîTaqseem conserves valuable resources like fuel, paper, and time, making food redistribution faster, cleaner, and more efficient.

<p>
<strong>Trade</strong>: Taqseem operates as a decentralized marketplace for food redistribution, connecting the supply of surplus food from donors with the demand from NGOs, creating a meaningful exchange rooted in social value rather than monetary transactions. It empowers small businesses like restaurants and grocery stores by providing a simple way to donate excess food, helping them cut disposal costs and enhance their public image. The platform also fosters volunteer micro-engagements, allowing individuals to contribute their time and earn badges or recognition‚Äîtransforming compassion into a new form of value exchange. With its adaptable framework, Taqseem can scale to different regions or countries, building a global network that supports inclusive, sustainable trade.
