Taqseem is revolutionizing food distribution by creating a real-time network between donors, NGOs, and volunteers. Whether it's a restaurant with leftover meals, a grocery store with surplus produce, or an individual with extra food, our platform ensures it reaches people who need it most - efficiently and without waste.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è &nbsp;Problem Statement 

<blockquote style="font-size: 18px;">
"Every year, 1.3 billion tons of food is wasted globally while 821 million people go hungry."
<br> <br>
"Current food donation systems are fragmented, slow, and lack real-time coordination between donors and charities."
</blockquote>
<br>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/196402/icode/">FAO</a>, food waste represents a $1 trillion economic loss annually while exacerbating hunger and environmental problems.</p> 

The challenge is twofold: perfectly good food goes to waste because donors don't have efficient ways to connect with distribution networks, while NGOs struggle to locate and coordinate timely pickups of available food. Traditional systems rely on manual coordination, leading to delays, spoilage, and missed opportunities to feed those in need.
